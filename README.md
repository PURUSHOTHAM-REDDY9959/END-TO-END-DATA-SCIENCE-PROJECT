# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification – End-to-End Data Science Project

This repository contains a complete end-to-end data science project that demonstrates how to go from **data collection and preprocessing** to **model training, saving, and deployment** using **Flask**. The project is based on the popular **Iris Flower Classification** problem using a machine learning model built with `scikit-learn`.
## 📚 Dataset: Iris

The **Iris dataset** is a well-known classification dataset in the machine learning community. It contains 150 instances of iris flowers, each described by four numerical features:

- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

Each flower belongs to one of three species:
- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

This dataset is clean, well-structured, and perfect for learning and demonstration purposes.


## 🚀 Project Overview

This project walks you through the process of:

1. Loading and preparing the Iris dataset
2. Preprocessing the data with `StandardScaler`
3. Training a machine learning model (`RandomForestClassifier`)
4. Saving the trained model and scaler using `pickle`
5. Creating a web interface using **Flask**
6. Deploying the model as a web application with an HTML form

It provides a simple, educational, and production-ready structure that you can reuse for your own ML deployment projects.
